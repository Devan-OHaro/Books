# Loss of Hope
Based on:
- lots of doctor's input
- edibles exaserbating thoughts
- unable to see future like before

## Element
- "There's no world out there for you other than this"
- "You'll just be a small part of a few people's memories"
- "How will you spend your approaching, final days?"
- Say goodbye without answers to or from MC

Who's saying this?
I'm thinking it would be someone/something internal.
Maybe "evil MC"? or something "inside" that's taking over?

What's the story conflict at this point where these questions would reach him?

Searching for cure? Too "on the nose" again?

Something more abstract, I think.
Maybe there's a map that leads to some wealth of knowledge.
Doesn't lead anywhere maybe, it just keeps going forever somehow (circle leads?).

Why is he/she searching for the knowledge?
What does it contain?

Coming from the "Understanding" conflict, maybe we can bridge the two.
Sacrifice self for "world peace"?

What would one person be able to do?

Maybe a device to impart his morality and beliefs on others? (MC is villian?)
