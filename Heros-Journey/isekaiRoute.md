# World building
* People randomly get inducted to other world
* Other world has to be dealt with otherwise death
* battleground/desert/fantasy/fog? World that evolves? Changes with each iteration, but is the same?
	- Small mobs as enemy?
* Transported to other world seemlying random (mostly isn’t)
* still functions in “real” world just at a different capacity
	- Most energy is spent in one place or the other
	- Cancer never spelled out, but treatment of some sort
* Same people in different world, but they are “less” than the real people
	- can be good can be bad
* Everyone else knows about the separate world
* Energy is split between two worlds
* Emotions are shared (depression episode)
* Connection to operators through some umbilical cord (some better than others) (constant problem)

# Characters
* Operators
* “Fairies”
* Family/friends
* Other-worlders
* Teachers

# Conflicts
* People know about separate world, but don’t pay it much mind
* People just say, you’ve seemed “fine” or “normal” while the mc is “away”
* Some people take pity on MC. Some people don’t take it seriously enough.
* Which version of a character are they talking to? “reality” or other world version
* tools that characters give to help with other world have negative side-effects
* Characters trying to help MC have different goals/expectations
* Characters start to give up on MC
* MC has to navigate both worlds simultaneously sometimes
* Being pulled in both world’s directions
* Not having energy for either place
* Feeling out of place in both
* People suggest things to do on your “time off” (treatment, exercise)

# Elements
* People enjoy MC drinking N/A drinks while they drink normally (MC really gets nothing from it)

# Outline
    1. Call to adventure – Faints out of blue and goes to Fantasy realm
        i. Supernatural aid – Confusion. Fairies find him and give prognosis, operator gives diagnosis
    2. Threshold guardians – Mob erradication. Chip away at MC, but doesn’t really do much on their own.
    3. Threshold – It’s revealed that all of them need to be erased. No “Demon lord” or anything. Start in small setting and grow from there
        i. Helper
        ii. Mentor
        iii. Challenges
        iv. Temptations
    4. Abyss (death and rebirth)
    5. Transformation
    6. Atonement
    7. Return
# Ideas
* Understand real consequences through going back to real world and seeing panic attack after trying to court girl (tried to be normal, can’t go back)
* One of first instances of story: very proud and able to fight easily, think this will be a piece of cake, only to be humbled and realize that he isn’t invincible (theme of first arc)
* through repeated use of tool operators gave him, lost hip/leg over course of first arc
* unable to travel between worlds in third arc. Stuck in limbo that makes him just go through motions of both worlds barely functioning (depression arc) everything fuzzy
* Explosion at one point from everyone asking him to do normal things in second arc and on
