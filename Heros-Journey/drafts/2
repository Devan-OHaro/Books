The ARC Endurance is a ship built in the 90’s, so there was always work to be done throughout the engine room. The crew was a part of a union that scrutinized their labor efforts and it was particularly random for people getting jobs. This meant that the crew were subjected to a lot of work without assurance that they’ll get a job in the near future. They were great. It really was the crew vs. the system rather than anything drama related – drama can get out of hand on ships that are only around 20 crew members, and thankfully on my first voyage, I avoided that. I was learning a lot from the other engineers and seamen. Engine rooms were a piece of cake if you took the time to look at the system schematics, the manuals for the different equipment, read over procedures that you were about to perform. Easy if you took the time. Some of the sailors only take in what has been passed down from person to person though and does little studying outside of that. I was forced to study though since I was still apart of school and was on the ship to learn as a midshipman. I studied what diesel engines were and how electricity flowed throughout the ship, even the procedure to clean a fuel oil purifier. I had tons of knowledge. That’s why I needed to help the new Third Assistant engineer coming aboard this week.
