MC enjoys his job shipbuilding.
It has the regiment he needs in his life to be as predictable as possible with only the smallest amount of unplanned work adding some flair to the job.
He directed the shipyard in operating the newly manufactured systems, so he had to know the mechanical, electrical, and new drive systems limits.
MC does his work with much consideration for others.
Helps others and volunteers to a fault.
When it comes to his friends, he helps them with whatever they need and gets a little needy when they don't show the same amount of respect back to him.
He loves them regardless, like his family.
Family is still in the picture, he talks to them on video calls or phone calls and updates them with job and different goals.
Works out for physical health by running.
Someone just ran a half-marathon, so he thought he'd get some training on the artificial gravity ship.
Noticed that the artificial gravity was a little higher than anticipated, and it wasns't perfectly aligned with the space station.
Someone else training on the ship noticed that MC was unable to work as hard as he usually does (operator).
MC decides to train on regular 1.0x gravity but is still struggling.
Operator is seen "stalking" him.
MC collapses from extra gravity and pins and needles start to torment him while on the ground.
Operator steps in and sees influence direction for all these events.
He attacks in that direction, but it's not effective.
Asks MC to power through it and gives him a tool to attack in the direction that he sees best.
MC sees what appears to be eyes and attacks that way.
His pins and needles go away and gravity lets up almost entirely.
Operator provides exposition.

What can only be described as aliens tormet what seems to be random people in this universe.
It usually starts off with extra gravity, but as the aliens (or whatever we're going to call them) continue, the effects they establish get worse and worse.
People in these situations are encouraged to fight back as much as they can since it seems that the more resistance there is to the aliens influence, the less they are able to influence until sometimes they just go away.
This isn't garunteed, but it's better than laying down and accepting it.
This operator explains that he uses special technology and tools to help gain some insight into the alien's attacks and is able to provide different tools and help for the people afflicted by this.
This operator also explains that the more proactive they are at getting back at the aliens, the better the chance they'll go away.
He even says that if you work through enough investigation, you can help provide better insight for others afflicted by this.
He tries to convice the MC that this is a short journey that he should go through.
Usually these types of afflictions are taken care of by identifying the different sources of influence placed nearby the person affected by this.
The aliens have to place these so that they can get "local" control of the effects.

The MC discusses it with people he knows and gets some insight to what others have experienced when it comes to this.
No one has dealt with it directly, but they all show simpathy that this is happening to the MC, someone they know.
They all show support, but the MC says that this was promised to be relatviely easy and only needs the help of the operator.

The operator shows up at the meeting point via a remote controlled screen and he provides some tools to help out.
He also introduces the MC to fairies (if we're calling them that).
MC is a little dissapointed that he feels alone, but the fairies are company enough and he'll be in direct communication the whole time.
MC ventures out.

## Thoughts
Since this is just a running FIRST draft of my thoughts, I'm thinking here we talk about the event that causes the first real trauma.
Along the way there will be scenes that add to everythihng he's dealing with, but the first time the MC has to deal with a real, life-changing issue is this one.
Towards the end of the first confrontation, the MC will lose his leg.
I'm thinking there's got to be a way to lose this leg without him reallizing it until it's too late and then finally it is completel ripped off.
The ironic part of the loss of the leg is that it will be from the tools/equipment of the Operators he works with - not the aliens.
So, we have to include reasons to use these tools and we have to include why the leg and we have to include how it slowly gets to him.

1. The conflict has to be agressive in nature, like the tools are guns or something.
There has to be a defined enemy - using the aliens that are a very symbolic or unknown force won't work here and it won't work as just the character "firing in that direction to get them off the trail" or whatever.
Aliens should produce mob-like force for first encounters and MC gains some confidence in the trials.
Thinking that the "gun" is something that is attached to his life-force of some kind.

2. Each treatment of the mobs or whatever uses that force which makes the syptoms worse, but if it's all well-timed, then the recovery can be fine.
MC doesn't have that luxury, recovering mana/life-force won't work in his case since the threat is also attached to his life-force.
MC is confident his life will last while mobs will go first.

3. MC starts to notice sluggishness after firing weapon.
Joints start to hurt.
Final push to destroy final crystal/alien hub MC is in position to fire tool from leg or something (just pinning it all on the leg).
Loses it, replaced with mechanical leg.

## How we get there (continuing in order)
