The world slowly changes in the perspective of the MC.
At first, they might see an aperition that only hurts the MC, and he's tasked with defeating it.
As time goes on, the world changes more and more.
The next day, buttons on his game console start to shock him slightly, he has to walk through sandstorms that cut him up as he walks outside.
The world slowly changes, it gains rules that have no logic.
The rules change without warning.

But what makes this engaging?
What makes someone want to cheer them on rather than is just be a suffering fest?

Chases rumors or other quests
