# Book Writing Repository

Welcome to my Book Writing repository! This repository is designed to help me organize and track the process of writing multiple books, from initial brainstorming to polished final drafts. It also serves as a place to store LaTeX templates, outlines, and reference materials that are used across various writing projects.

## Repo Structure

This repository is organized into several directories that help me break down the writing process into manageable steps. Here's an overview of the file structure:

```
/Book-Writing-Repo

├── /books/                # Folder containing all book projects
│   ├── /book_name/        # Folder for each individual book
│   │   ├── README.md      # Book-specific overview, progress updates
│   │   ├── /outline/      # Book outline and structure
│   │   ├── /drafts/       # Early drafts and experimental writing
│   │   ├── /chapters/     # LaTeX files for each chapter
│   │   ├── /images/       # Images, figures, and other media
│   │   ├── references.bib # LaTeX bibliography file
│   │   ├── /final/        # Polished final version of the book
│   └── /another_book/     # Folder for another book
│
├── /templates/            # LaTeX templates and styling files
│   └── book_template.tex  # Basic book structure template

│
├── /scripts/              # Automation scripts (LaTeX compilation, etc.)
│   └── compile.sh         # Script to compile LaTeX files
│
├── /docs/                 # Documentation for the repository and workflow

## Directory Breakdown

### `/books/`
This directory contains individual projects (books), each with its own dedicated folder. Each book folder includes:

- **`README.md`**: A summary of the specific book project. This file includes progress updates, timelines, and any relevant notes about the project.
- **`outline/`**: This folder holds the outline for the book, including chapter structure, key themes, or any other planning material.
- **`drafts/`**: A space to store early drafts, rough sketches, or brainstorming. These are works-in-progress that may not be fully fleshed out.
- **`chapters/`**: LaTeX files for the chapters of the book. Each chapter has its own `.tex` file to keep the book modular and manageable. These files will be compiled together into the final document.
- **`images/`**: Contains images, diagrams, or figures used within the book. These can be referenced in the LaTeX files.
- **`references.bib`**: A LaTeX `.bib` file for storing references, sources, and citations for the book.
- **`final/`**: Once the book is complete, the final version of the LaTeX file(s) and the PDF will be stored here.

### `/templates/`
This folder contains reusable LaTeX templates and style files for your books. A basic template might look like this:

- **`book_template.tex`**: A skeleton LaTeX file for starting new books, with a predefined structure for chapters, sections, and formatting.

### `/metadata/`
This directory contains files that help track and manage all books in one place:

- **`books.json`**: A JSON file that stores metadata for each book, including the title, description, status (e.g., outlining, drafting, completed), and any notes related to each project.
- **`index.md`**: A Markdown file that lists all the books you’re working on, with links to each project folder and updates on their current progress.

### `/scripts/`
This folder contains any automation scripts that can help streamline the writing or compiling process:

- **`compile.sh`**: A script that compiles LaTeX files, runs necessary pre-compiling steps (like BibTeX for references), and outputs the final PDF. It can be customized as needed for each project.

### `/docs/`
This directory contains documentation about how to use the repository and best practices for working with LaTeX:

- **`usage_guide.md`**: A guide for setting up your environment, working with LaTeX, and how to interact with the files in the repository.
