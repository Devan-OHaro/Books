# Raw Ideas



* Something of a reflection on my own life
* Future/Space setting for story
* Something like starship troopers with following different people in different walks of life in the same world/story
* Travel system needs to be made (how faster than light?)
* Future technology that makes fighting system different - computer hacking?
* Currency system?
* Focus on one town/city/community and exemplify how the world outside them affects them, how it doesn't affect them, what perspective they care about
